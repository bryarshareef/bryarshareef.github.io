<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome to my professional homepage! I am Dr. Bryar Shareef, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/cs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Nevada, Las Vegas</a>. Before joining UNLV, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://uidaho.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Idaho</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/mxian/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Min Xian</a>. Additionally, I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Salahaddin University-Erbil, Iraq, and an M.S. in Computer Science from Western Michigan University, USA. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance healthcare outcomes. Specifically, I develop advanced deep learning models for medical imaging, with a particular emphasis on breast cancer detection using ultrasound. My work includes the development of a hybrid multitask CNN-Transformer network, which has significantly improved the accuracy of tumor classification and segmentation. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In recognition of my research contributions, I received the Graduate Fellowship from the University of Idaho in 2022. My work has been published in numerous prestigious journals and conferences, and I am actively involved in the academic community as a reviewer for various scientific journals and conferences.</p>
