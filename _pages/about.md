<p style="text-align:justify">
Welcome to my professional homepage. I am Dr. Bryar Shareef, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the
<a href="https://www.unlv.edu/cs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Nevada, Las Vegas</a>.
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
<a href="https://uidaho.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Idaho</a>.
My research develops practical and trustworthy AI methods for healthcare and forensics, with a strong emphasis on multimodal learning,
medical imaging, and clinical decision support.
</p>
<p>
As Director of the Advanced AI Research Lab (AAR Lab), I mentor Ph.D., M.S., and undergraduate students on research projects spanning vision–language models, multimodal learning, and trustworthy AI for real-world applications</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
My work spans large vision models (vision–language models), multimodal deep learning, multitask learning, graph neural networks,
and agentic AI. I am also interested in AR/VR/MR applications that enable interactive visualization, annotation, and human-in-the-loop
workflows for medical and forensic analysis.
</p>

## Research Areas

### Large Vision Models (Vision–Language Models) and Multimodal Deep Learning
<p style="text-align:justify">
I build multimodal models that integrate imaging, text, structured descriptors, and clinical context. Current directions include
vision–language learning for segmentation/reporting, robust fusion under missing modalities, and grounding strategies to reduce
hallucinations in clinical outputs.
</p>

### Medical Image Analysis across Modalities
<p style="text-align:justify">
I develop deep learning methods for diagnosis, segmentation, and risk prediction using medical imaging modalities including
ultrasound, mammography, and CBCT. Application areas include breast cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, brain cancer, histopathology,
and image-guided clinical workflows.
</p>

### Multitask Learning and Graph Neural Networks
<p style="text-align:justify">
I design multitask architectures that jointly learn complementary clinical targets (e.g., detection + segmentation + reporting),
and graph-based methods that model relationships among anatomical structures, findings, and longitudinal clinical patterns.
</p>

### Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Time-Series Prediction
<p style="text-align:justify">
I analyze electronic health records and clinical time series for early warning and decision support, including in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA)
prediction. This includes handling missingness and imbalance, interpretable risk models, and evaluation under real-world constraints.
</p>

### Agentic AI and AR/VR/MR for Interactive Healthcare and Forensics
<p style="text-align:justify">
I am exploring agentic AI systems that can plan, retrieve evidence, and generate structured outputs under safety constraints.
I am also interested in AR/VR/MR interfaces that support interactive review of imaging findings, guided annotation, and explainable
decision support for both healthcare and forensic applications.
</p>

### Forensic Analysis Using AI
<p style="text-align:justify">
My forensic direction focuses on AI-driven analysis of craniofacial and dental imaging (including CBCT) for tasks such as morphometric
measurement, population/sex/age estimation, and structured reporting. I am interested in multimodal and evidence-centered pipelines
that combine imaging with contextual metadata.
</p>

<h3>🚀 Prospective Students</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
I am recruiting motivated M.S. and Ph.D. students with strong programming and mathematical foundations. If you are interested in
vision–language models, multimodal learning, medical imaging, EHR modeling, graph neural networks, agentic AI, or AR/VR/MR applications,
please email me at <b>bryar.shareef[at]unlv.edu</b> with your CV and a short description of your interests and research goals.
