<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome to my professional homepage! I am Dr. Bryar Shareef, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/cs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Nevada, Las Vegas</a>. Before joining UNLV, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://uidaho.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Idaho</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/mxian/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Min Xian</a>. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance healthcare outcomes. Specifically, I develop advanced deep learning models for medical imaging, with a particular emphasis on breast cancer detection using ultrasound. My work includes the development of a hybrid multitask CNN-Transformer network, which has significantly improved the accuracy of tumor classification and segmentation. I am actively involved in the academic community as a reviewer for various scientific journals and conferences.</p>

## Research Areas

### Medical Image Analysis
<p style="text-align:justify">Our research in medical image analysis focuses on breast cancer detection using advanced deep learning models. We work on breast ultrasound, histopathology images, and ophthalmology imaging to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.</p>

### Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVM)
<p style="text-align:justify">We explore the development and application of large language models and large vision models to improve understanding and inference in various domains, including healthcare and natural language processing.</p>

### Interpretable Models and Explainable Machine Learning
<p style="text-align:justify">Our research aims to develop interpretable models and explainable machine learning techniques to foster trust and transparency in AI systems, particularly in critical applications like healthcare.</p>

### Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
<p style="text-align:justify">We focus on analyzing electronic health records to identify trends and patterns. Our work highlights in-hospital cardiac arrest analysis, aiming to improve early detection and intervention strategies.</p>

### Multi-Task Learning for Brain MRI
<p style="text-align:justify">Our research involves leveraging multi-task learning approaches to improve the analysis and diagnosis of brain MRI scans, enabling better understanding and treatment of neurological conditions.</p>

<h3>üöÄüßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è‚ö°Currently Recruiting‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó</h3>
